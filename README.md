# Thief-Detector-and-alert-system-

An IoT-based security system designed to detect unauthorized access or theft attempts and immediately alert the user. The system uses sensors, microcontrollers, and communication modules to monitor surroundings and trigger alarms/notifications when suspicious activity is detected.

🚀 Features

📡 Intruder Detection using motion sensors (PIR/Ultrasonic).

🔔 Alarm Activation through buzzer/LED when intrusion is detected.

📱 Real-Time Alerts sent via GSM/Wi-Fi (SMS/Email/IoT Dashboard).

🔒 Automatic Logging of intrusion events for security records.

⚡ Low Power Consumption for continuous monitoring.

🛠️ Components Used

Microcontroller: Arduino/ESP32/NodeMCU

Sensors: PIR sensor / Ultrasonic sensor

Buzzer & LED: For local alert

GSM/Wi-Fi Module: To send notifications

Power Supply: Battery/Adapter

⚙️ Working Principle

The motion sensor detects movement in the secured area.

When unusual motion is detected, the microcontroller processes the signal.

A buzzer and LED are activated for local alert.

Simultaneously, a notification (SMS/IoT dashboard alert) is sent to the owner.

The system can be reset manually or automatically after the event is logged.
📊 Applications

Home Security

Shop/Office Surveillance

ATM Security

Warehouse & Storage Monitoring

🔮 Future Improvements

Add camera module for live monitoring.

Enable AI-based face recognition for false-alarm reduction.

Integrate with cloud IoT platforms (Thingspeak, Blynk, Firebase).
